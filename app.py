Ideally, you should pre-populate each form field with the existing data on load. So the form is filled out with the existing data so the User can easily see what the value is and make edits to the form to make the update.

NOTE: Updating a project should not result in a new project being created, this behavior would not be seen as editing this would be adding a new project. To check this, you can simply make an edit and then reload the listing page to see if a duplicate record was created.
